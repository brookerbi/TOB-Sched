# TOB-Sched
TOB-Sched is a topological order balancing-driven scheduling algorithm designed to improve modeling accuracy in Boolean processor-based emulation (PBE) compilation flows.

This repository provides the core algorithmic components of TOB-Sched, including mobility-prioritized node selection, gain calculation, and efficient forward and backward propagation, as described in our paper.

The current release focuses on the key algorithmic modules. A more complete version with user-friendly interfaces and documentation is under active development and will be released in the near future.
