# TOB-Sched
Addressing the challenge of accurate modeling time step in the complex instruction execution process of the Boolean processor-based emulation (PBE) compilation flow, TOB-Sched proposes a topological order balancing-driven scheduling algorithm. It delivers superior PBE performance and establishes a new frontier for this area.

This version contains the main algorithms of TOB-Sched, such as mobility-prioritized node selection, gain calculation, and efficient forward and backward propagation. Note that the complete version will be released in a future update.
