# TOB-Sched
Addressing the challenge of accurate modeling time step in the complex instruction execution process of the Boolean processor-based emulation (PBE) compilation flow, TOB-Sched proposes a topological order balancing-driven scheduling algorithm. It delivers superior PBE performance and establishes a new frontier for this area.
